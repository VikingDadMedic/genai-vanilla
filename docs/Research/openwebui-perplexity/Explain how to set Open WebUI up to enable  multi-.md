# Explain how to set Open WebUI up to enable  multi-turn conversations and what's required - how it works, etc.

Open WebUI supports multi-turn conversations out of the box via chat history and optional long-term memory; enabling both chat history persistence and the experimental memory feature provides the best multi-turn behavior with personalization beyond model context limits[^1][^2][^3].

## What “multi-turn” means

Multi-turn in Open WebUI has two layers: (1) conversational history sent to the LLM per request until the model’s context fills, and (2) optional long-term “Memory” that persists facts and preferences outside the context window and can be retrieved when relevant without consuming tokens by default[^2][^1]. History enables immediate coherence across recent turns, while Memory provides durable personalization and factual recall across sessions[^2][^3].

## Prerequisites

- A running Open WebUI deployment (Docker recommended), connected to a model backend (e.g., Ollama or an OpenAI-compatible API)[^1].
- Admin access to set environment variables and features if needed, plus user access to Settings > Personalization for Memory configuration[^1][^4].
- Optional: configured embeddings backend and vector store if using advanced memory and knowledge workflows (Chroma default; Qdrant, pgvector, Milvus, OpenSearch also discussed in community docs)[^5][^6].


## How chat history works

Open WebUI stores each conversation’s messages and automatically includes recent turns when sending a request to the selected model until hitting the model’s context limit[^1][^7]. Administrators and users can control how many messages are included, and community discussions reference toggles and limits that affect what portion of history is forwarded to the API[^7][^8]. Chat history is independent of the experimental “Memory” feature and is always the primary mechanism for short-horizon multi-turn coherence[^1][^2].

## Enabling long‑term Memory

- Navigate to Settings > Personalization > Memory and toggle it on; add or edit memory items (facts, preferences, constraints) as needed[^1][^3].
- Current behavior: Open WebUI does not automatically extract and save memories like MemGPT; users curate memories manually or via community functions/tools designed for auto-memory[^2][^9].
- Stored memories do not count against the model’s context by default; they live in a separate store and are retrieved when relevant, similar to RAG-style lookups, then injected as needed[^2][^3].


## Making it robust: environment and settings

- Environment-configurable prompts and features: For example, follow-up generation and chat history templating can be set via PersistentConfig environment variables to improve continuity and suggest next prompts[^10].
- Key variables: ENABLE_FOLLOW_UP_GENERATION and FOLLOW_UP_GENERATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE control automatic follow-ups based on chat history; templates include {{MESSAGES:END:n}} selectors that reference recent turns[^10].
- If deploying multi-user, ensure RBAC and privacy settings are correct to prevent history bleed-over; there are reports of intermittent UI exposure of other users’ titles, so keep versions updated and verify admin flags (e.g., ENABLE_ADMIN_CHAT_ACCESS=false)[^11][^12].


## Knowledge base for context beyond Memory

For domain knowledge, use Workspaces > Knowledge to ingest documents and enable RAG retrieval alongside chat history; this complements Memory by storing larger corpora and retrieving relevant chunks without exhausting the context window[^13][^14]. Vector backends can be swapped from Chroma to external stores, but switching embedding models requires re-embedding content for compatibility[^5][^6].

## Auto‑memory and agentic add‑ons

- Community “Auto Memory” function and “Memory Tool” let the assistant propose or perform memory writes/reads/deletes, making long-term memory more automatic with OpenAI function-calling style flows[^9][^15].
- These add-ons are optional and run as functions/tools; they can monitor messages, suggest memory candidates, and persist them via valves-configured credentials or storage backends[^9][^15].


## How it works under the hood

- Chat history: Open WebUI stores messages in its database and slices recent turns into the request according to policy/limits before calling the selected model API[^1][^7].
- Memory: Memory entries are stored separately and fetched via search when relevant; the result is summarized or inlined as system/context content, preserving the main history budget[^2][^3].
- Follow-ups: Optional generator uses a template that sees recent history to propose 3–5 next steps, improving continuity through user-driven next turns[^10].


## Step‑by‑step setup checklist

1) Deploy Open WebUI and connect a model (Ollama or OpenAI-compatible); verify a simple multi-turn chat works[^1][^4].
2) Enable chat history: use defaults and optionally tune history window/limits in settings or env (community issues discuss making the limit adjustable)[^7][^8].
3) Enable Memory: Settings > Personalization > Memory; add seed facts and preferences to test retrieval across sessions[^1][^3].
4) Optionally install auto-memory functions/tools from the community to propose/commit memories during conversations[^9][^15].
5) If using knowledge beyond memories, create a Knowledge base in Workspace and attach it to a custom model or chat; ingest documents and confirm RAG retrieval[^13][^14].
6) Consider follow-up generation: set ENABLE_FOLLOW_UP_GENERATION=true and adjust FOLLOW_UP_GENERATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE to promote deeper multi-turn flows[^10].
7) For multi-user setups, verify RBAC, workspace resource permissions, and privacy flags; upgrade to the latest release to avoid cross-user UI artifacts[^11][^12].

## Requirements summary

- Core: Open WebUI deployment, connected model backend, chat history enabled (default)[^1][^4].
- For durable continuity: Memory enabled and populated (manual or with auto-memory function/tool)[^1][^9].
- For domain recall: Knowledge base and embeddings configured; re-embed if changing embedding models[^13][^5].
- For multi-user: RBAC and privacy flags configured; monitor release notes for fixes and improvements[^16][^12].


## Practical tips and limitations

- Multi-turn coherence degrades when the model’s context fills; mitigate by enabling Memory and Knowledge and by tuning how many past messages are sent per turn[^7][^2].
- Memory is not fully automatic by default; consider community auto-memory extensions to reduce manual curation burden[^9][^17].
- Keep deployments updated; some users observed intermittent cross-user history title exposure, underscoring the need for current versions and careful config[^11][^12].
- Follow-up generation can meaningfully steer conversations and reduce dead-ends, especially for task-oriented flows[^10][^18].

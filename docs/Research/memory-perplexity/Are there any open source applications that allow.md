# Are there any open source applications that allow for AI chat that allow for utilizing/storing/retrieving ‘memories’? Open WebUI? Import / export memories?

Yes—there are several open-source apps and libraries that support AI chat with persistent “memories,” including Open WebUI’s built-in Memory and community Pipelines/Functions, plus standalone memory layers like Mem0 and Memori that can be integrated into agents and UIs. Open WebUI supports export/import at the database level today, and community functions and pipelines add automatic memory capture; Mem0 and emerging engines like Memori and memU focus on long‑term memory storage, retrieval, and compression that can be wired into chat apps and agents. [^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6][^7]

## Open WebUI

- Open WebUI lists portable import/export and configuration portability among its features, enabling replication of settings across systems. For full data moves (chats, configs), the documented path is exporting/importing the SQLite database file webui.db or equivalent when using Docker or migrating instances. This approach captures memory-like data stored within the app’s DB along with chats and settings. [^1][^2]
- Community discussions and videos show an “experimental” Memory setting under Personalization that allows adding and managing user profile-like memories injected into chats; this is visible in recent community content and walkthroughs, though the exact UX is evolving. [^8][^9]
- There’s a community “Auto Memory Function” that automatically identifies and stores relevant chat snippets as Memories inside Open WebUI, which can be enabled as a function to persist and later retrieve context while chatting. [^3]


## Import/export in Open WebUI

- Official docs provide a straight path to export/import by copying webui.db out of or into the container (docker cp open-webui:/app/backend/data/webui.db ./webui.db and the reverse), effectively moving all user data including chats and settings; this is the current, reliable way to migrate or back up “memories” stored in-app. For PostgreSQL, a DB-level dump/restore would be analogous. [^2]
- Third-party admin guides also indicate UI-level export for models/config and “export all chats” capabilities in distro builds (e.g., SUSE packaging), underscoring that model/config exports are available, while full “memory” portability typically rides on database export/import. [^10]


## Mem0 (open source memory layer)

- Mem0 is an open-source “universal memory layer” for AI assistants and agents that stores, compresses, and retrieves user/agent memories to personalize responses and reduce token costs; it’s designed to slot into existing apps and frameworks. It offers SDKs and examples and is actively discussed in the Open WebUI community for Pipelines integration. [^4][^11][^12]
- Community threads note an Open WebUI Pipeline example for Mem0 and some broken/aging examples; integration is feasible but may require patching current pipeline code or using community adapters (e.g., cloudsbird/mem0-owui), especially if pairing with Ollama. Expect some rough edges and verify the latest examples. [^12][^13][^14][^15]


## Memori and memU (emerging options)

- Memori (GibsonAI) is a recently announced open-source memory engine for AI agents that aims to automatically remember context (projects, tools, collaborators), reduce repeated backstory tokens, and improve consistency. It targets long-term agent memory and is positioned as an embeddable layer for apps. Being new, it may evolve rapidly. [^5]
- memU is another open-source framework focused on AI companion memory with an autonomous “Memory Agent,” structured memory files, knowledge-graph linking, and memory prioritization; it provides a Python client and cloud API, with community/enterprise plans and a local community edition roadmap. It’s geared to long-term, evolving memories. [^6][^7]


## Practical setup paths

- Open WebUI only: Enable the experimental Memory in Personalization and/or install the Auto Memory Function to capture key user details and preferences during chats; use DB export/import to migrate memories between instances. This keeps memory inside the app with minimal plumbing. [^8][^3][^2]
- Open WebUI + Mem0: Add a Pipeline filter/function that writes salient facts to Mem0 during/after messages and retrieves relevant memories on each turn to inject into the system prompt/context. Validate working examples and adjust for model backends (Ollama/OpenAI/OpenRouter). This gives cross-app memory portability outside the chat DB. [^12][^4][^13]
- Agent frameworks: Use Mem0 or Memori as the memory backend for multi-step agents (planner/tool-user) and front them with Open WebUI or another chat UI. This decouples memory from UI and allows import/export via the memory engine’s storage and APIs. [^5][^4]


## Import/export options summary

- Open WebUI
    - Chats/configs/memories stored in-app: export/import the database file (SQLite webui.db via docker cp), or equivalent DB dumps when using PostgreSQL; some distributions expose UI options to export chats/configs. [^2][^10]
    - Per-feature exports: Config and model lists support UI export/import, but granular “memory item” export is not yet a first-class native feature; use DB-level moves or functions that serialize memories. [^1][^10]
- Mem0/Memori/memU
    - External memory engines provide their own storage backends and APIs; import/export is typically handled via their SDKs or data stores, enabling portability across UIs and services. Check each project’s docs/SDK for export formats and migration scripts as they are updated. [^4][^5][^6]


## Notes and caveats

- Mem0 with Open WebUI Pipelines has community examples, but compatibility can lag; validate the pipeline class entry points and update references to current branch paths. Some users report pipeline bugs or issues when pairing with Ollama. [^12][^14][^13]
- Open WebUI’s experimental memory UI is evolving; expect changes in how personal memories are stored/surfaced. For stability and portability, database-level export/import remains the most dependable method today. [^8][^2]
- New open-source engines (Memori, memU) look promising for richer, evolving memory graphs, but production readiness and self-hosted community editions may still be maturing—pilot before standardizing. [^5][^6][^7]
